# CDS_Pacman

Respository created for Complex Digital Systems Design course at Rowan Univeristy, Spring 2022.
The objective of this project is to achieve an implementation of the classic Pac-Man arcade game 
through the use of the DE10-Standard development kit. RTL based sprite storage and VGA control combined with 
software based sprite movement through use of the ARM-based hard processor system (HPS) forms the backbone of this project.
